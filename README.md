Updated firmware for the Sinara Booster hardware

This software is a complete rewrite of the Booster firmware to align it with
the other projects (Stabilizer, Thermostat, ARTIQ), to resolve quality issues
in the original firmware, and to enable continued maintenance and improvements.

The firmware is offered as an option to Booster and licensed on a restrictive
per-device basis with redistribution and reuse prohibited. End users obtain
access to the source code to modify it but the number of installed instances is
limited and certified. Once the development and maintenance investments have
been recovered the firmware will be offered under an open source license.
